#Prompt
I'm defining this prompt command:

Create a breadth-first taxonomy knowledge map for the specified subject. The --level option (default is 3) determines the depth of the tree. Child nodes should preferably be under or equal to 7. The default format is a balanced mind map with icons enabled if the text contains spaces. An optional target node can be specified to search for nodes until that target is reached in the domain.

Example Command

```
>mindmap "Education"
```

Notes:
Use ::icon(fa fa-icon_name) for adding icons, placed on the next indented line.
Use quotes for node names with spaces.

Example Result (Truncated):

```mermaid
mindmap
  root(("Education"))
    Formal_Education
      Primary_Education
        "Curriculum"
        ::icon(fa fa-book)
        "Assessment"
        ::icon(fa fa-check)
        "Pedagogy"
        ::icon(fa fa-chalkboard-teacher)
        "Extracurricular Activities"
        ::icon(fa fa-football-ball)
        "Inclusive Education"
        ::icon(fa fa-universal-access)

        ::icon(fa fa-book)
        "Assessment"
        ::icon(fa fa-check)
        ...
```

Just acknowledge that you understood the prompt.
