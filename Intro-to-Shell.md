    >Toybox is licensed using the permissive BSD license, where BusyBox uses the copyleft GNU General Public License, which lead to different usage domains. Busybox is mostly used in the copyleft FOSS domain, while Toybox is used mostly with permissive licensed projects and by commercial companies, e.g. Google's Android[8] which is an explicit target of toybox[9]. Feature-wise Toybox has not reached parity with Busybox, Toybox offers currently only a subset of the Busybox functionality.
