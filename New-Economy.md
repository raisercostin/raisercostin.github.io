The new economy should be a function of:
- old economy parameters
  - [x] cost
  - [x] market
  - [ ] regulations
- time effects: new comers to the table should get similar rights to resources (meaning newborns rich or pour)
- morality: what is immoral should cost more
- ecology: what is destroying ecology should cost more

## Cases
- morality on future owners: resource(nature, ecosystems, clean air) depletion
- morality on other beings: do not use people as means but as purpose
  - on animals
    - intelligent: dolphins, pigs, octopus, crows
  - [x] on other people: races, classes, location, sex, sexual orientation
  - [ ] on noncontributing people: robots outsmart us
