# Why they will not work:
1. Technical
   - scalability - as the system grows is harder and harder to manage transactions
   - splitting the network - working offline
     - one bad actor (China) might decide to split the network and to create a parallel transaction history (ledger)
2. Practical
   - The Bourse where people open accounts to play is periodically robbed since money have no trace. Happened in Japan.
   - Big players play game and the currency is highly volatile.
   - The mining already discovered around 80% of total bitcoins in 2017.

3. Others
   - Moral problems - you hide things in the name of [[privacy|Why privacy is bad]]

# Concerns
- Not clear what are full implications of capped size: deflation among them.

# What will work
- playing short term luck games hoping to guess the big players direction
- creating a voucher/virtual currency that is controlled by both authorities and groups. See namek.
