## Projects that I might never create

- An personal assistant that will provide the same feeling of completion when you read a book but for websites. It should compute the total website size and how many "pages"/"sentences" were read. For example ... what percentage from the content [here](http://developer.android.com/guide/) I read? This should also answer to the question: Do people read nowadays?
