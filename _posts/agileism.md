Manifesto for Agile Society Development

qa.agileism.org - our forum




We are uncovering better ways of developing
society by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working society over comprehensive documentation
People collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.
