= Given that
: RIsk Takers
"Some people are risk takers, you know the usuals: Gates, Jobs, Musk."
To be an antreprenour you must take risks. 

: Safety net
Your protection in a worse case situation.


= Theory
Each person is taking risks at a specific level.  That level is highly determined by the safety 
net that he has. Safety nets are at multiple levels for example determined by the Maslow 
Hierarchy of needs:
- Physiological needs
- Safety needs
- Love and belonging
- Esteem
- Self-actualization
- Self-transcendence

If a person can be safe in a worse case siutation and still be on a specific level like esteem
then that person can take more risks than a person that doesn't have a safety net or has one
only for Physiological needs.

= Safety net levels
A safety net could be perceived as a long term strategic need. While they are connected with the
needs they express a more rationalized need: "In the worse case scenario, I would like x,y,z to
happen till the end of my life". It's a form of waranty/assurance.
1. Water, Food, Sleep
2. Lifetime lodgining
3. Lifetime utilities paid

= Samples

- Worse case scenario for Gates, Jobs, Musk would have been Esteem: they had a rich enough
family to support their needs in case they couldn't earn a dime.

- A person that is concerned by putting a bread on the table would be much more risk averse
since in the worst case scenario she doesn't have a safety net.
