[](define risk takers)
There are giants like Gates, Jobs, Musk that take risks. You, on the other side, you are not
an successful entrepreneur since you're risk averse. You're used to take it easy, to take it
gradually step by step.

[](define safety nets)
In the end they take risks because they have good, reliable *safety nets*. In worst case situation they 
know that it can't be that bad. They can trade an survivable event for big gains.

# Needs and Safety Nets for them

Some people have safety nets on lodging, water, food, sleep. Others have better safety nets:
they have a comfortable house, a comfortable passive income (why do the retired persons don't 
take risks anymore?). Maslow came up with a sensible hierarchy of needs and according to these 
needs you have various safety nets: physiological safety net, safety safety net (sic!), love and
belonging safety net, eestem safety net, self-actualization safety net, self-transcedence safety net.

If a person wrote a novel or discovered the relativity theory it got a good reliable Esteem Safety Net.
Whatever it discoveres (or not) in the future, in worst case, he will not be in need for esteem. This net will enable 
Einstein to pursue line of thoughts/theories that others cannot because they must prove themself worthy
before this.

About _unconditional love_ I can say is a nice safety net for love and belonging need. And it works
for long term partnerships: relation, parent-child, brothers-sisters. If is enabled the person can
pursue higher goals and take more risks on the "love and belonging" related activities. It could
become a Jobs of the relationships: a kind of a Dalai Lama or maybe Don Juan (#dontknowyet)?

# Safety Net Timespan

There is something more on safety nets than a simple satisfaction of needs. A safety net should
_save your life_ in a worst case scenarion so it must be there for a long term, idealy for life. You
cannot say, "thanks god I had a safety net for that day with my botle of water from the knapsack".
In that case you with luck you escaped but on the long term you're doomed to fail. You're saved if 
you have a strategy or a system that will save for most cases.

A safety net could be perceived as a long term strategic way to satisfy a need. It is a long term 
solution that gives psychological confort and lower the ball for assuming risks. The safety net 
satisfies a rationalized need: "In the worse case scenario, my x,y,z need will be satisfied till the end 
of my life". It's a form of waranty/assurance. There are several patterns related to the safety nets:

1. Struggled Life - No assurance
	There are communities that don't get any assurances. Usually are the states with a low life 
	expectancy. Everyday is a struggle because every action might not be bearable. Of course by
	anyone other standards they are very risk averse.
2. Assured Destruction
	This situation might look like the previous but the risk averse behaviour transforms in a risk taking
	behavior because there is nothing to loose. in this case the safety net is given by the "anyway I will
	die, it cannot go worse than that". This makes a good case for a Minimum Waranted Income. That
	will transform the Assured Destruction and No Assurance (behaviours easily swappable) in a Stable
	Surviving Situation
3. Stable Surviving Situation
	This behaviour could be enabled by a Minimum Waranted Income. In this case you will know that 
	in any circumstance your live will not end abruptly in misery and/or abuse. You will have your
	primary needs satisfied.
4. Stable Job/Salary
  - might ensure a short term lodging/water/food/sleep safety net
  - might ensure a lifespan lodging/water/food/sleep safety net if pension is paid in a stable state
5. Buying assurances
 	You can buy Safety Net on various aspects of your life. Worse case scenario is still ok.
  	- health 
  		- accidents
  		- cronic issues
  		- expensive ills
  	- accidents
  		- cars
  		- apartments
  	- processes
  		- education
  		- life assurance
6. Lifetime lodgining
7. Lifetime utilities paid

# Samples

- Worse case scenario for Gates, Jobs, Musk would have been Esteem: they had a rich enough
family to support their needs in case they couldn't earn a dime.

- A person that is concerned by putting a bread on the table would be much more risk averse
since in the worst case scenario she doesn't have a safety net.
